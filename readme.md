# Credits
Most of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript came from [Ylorant's Splitty web app](https://github.com/ylorant/splitty). I took the different parts of the application and sectioned them out into a standalone application that was cross platform rather than a web app. This means that in the future we can take more advantage of saving, loading, and especially generating a page that browsersource (on OBS Studio) can use. No longer will people on Mac and Linux be confined to using software that is only partially functional.
